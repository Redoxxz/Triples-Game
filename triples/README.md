# triples

In this project, you will be implementing a simple tile-based game,
where tiles are merged to earn points. It is in three phases:

 * [Phase 1](phase1.md): Design and implement the model
 * [Phase 2](phase2.md): Implement the basic game functionality
 * [Phase 3](phase3.md): Make the game a nice-looking app

Grading will be based on the final phase 3 app, but you are encouraged
to request feedback on the earlier phases. For phase 1, we provide
unit tests for all of the required functionality of that phase.

Final grades will be assigned as follows:

 * **Excellent:** All phase 3 functionality is implemented correctly.
 * **Meets Expectations:** Some piece of functionality does not work correctly.
 * **Requires Resubmission:** Multiple pieces of functionality do not work
   correctly, but the phase 2 functionality works correctly.
 * **Not Assessible:** Phase 2 functionality does not work correctly.
